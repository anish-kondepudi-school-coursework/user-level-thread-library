# UTHREAD: User-level thread library

## Summary

The `uthread` library provides the user with a handful of useful methods to create and manage user-level threads such `uthread_run`, `uthread_create`, `uthread_yield`, `uthread_exit`. Additionally, the `uthread` facilitates the ability to synchronize threads and protect shared memory through the use of semaphores, which are exposed through the endpoints `sem_create`, `sem_destroy`, `sem_down`, `sem_up`. The `uthread` library also supports preemption among threads to prevent starvation.
